## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of image classification using the "Rock Paper Scissors" dataset. The main goal is to develop a machine learning model that can differentiate between images of rocks, papers, and scissors.

## Features

- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification.
- Augments image data to increase data variation.
- Splits dataset into training and validation sets.
- Monitors model performance with training and validation curves.
- Allows prediction of new images by uploading them.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Split Folders
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Ensure all requirements are installed by running the necessary package installations.
2. Download and extract the dataset into the project directory.
3. Run the Python script in an environment that supports TensorFlow.
4. Follow the steps outlined in the script to train, evaluate the model, and make predictions with new images.

## Usage

- Train your own model using the provided script.
- Evaluate the model's performance using the training and validation curves.
- Use the model to predict new images of rocks, papers, and scissors.
